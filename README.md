# Neoxathletics

Neoxathletics is a fitness based website that gives users info on nutrition and strength training.

Some features Neoxathletics offers is Calorie calculator and a 1 Rep max calculator.The calculations are then displayed by beautiful chart that shows the results. I decided to apply a visually appealing graph rather than dull numbers.

Some struggles I came across was getting correct formula to get the calculations for the 1 rep max and calories.
